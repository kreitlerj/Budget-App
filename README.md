# Budget-App
This is a simple app created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The user can input either income or expenses and the app will calculate a budget.  DOM manipulation is used to update the UI for all the changes the user makes.  Future considerations is to add a database to save the user inputs for later use and refactor the app.js file to use ES6.
